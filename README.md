bolin-time
==========

Getting up in the morning is a huge problem for us. It takes us a while to get ourselves out of bed, and then even  more time before we're actually ready to GSD and continue working towards learning cooler things, doing more awesome stuff and killing it in life.
Project (code name) "Bolin-Time" is an iOS app that will wake a user up at a pre-set time to a motivational speech-alarm, to get you pumped and motivated to kick ass during the day to come.


Trivia
=======

Bolin is a character in the Legend of Korra known for witty quips, a great sense of humor and, at times, motivational or inspiring moments.
As pretty big fans of the Legend of Korra, we felt it only appropriate to give a shoutout to bolin and all his awesome with this project.
